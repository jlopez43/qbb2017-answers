The deletion that can be seen in the second line containing ATTTTTTTTC and ATTTTTTTC can possibly cause a frameshift mutation.


The other lines in this top 5 show different possible mutations as well. This can be showing a missense mutation or a nonsense mutation. 

These mutations can possibly lead to serious errors in the gene sequence if not repaired.
